# Node-Logging

This is a logging library for use with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).  It decouples log reporting from publishing and is based on the [Java API](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/logging/Logger.html).

## Installation

Fork the latest source from github.

or

`npm install logg`

## Usage

Call `getLogger(name)` with the name of your class, namespace, or made up identifier.

Loggers expose `fine()`, `info()`, `warn()`, `error()` and `log(level, args)`.  These logging methods take variable arguments and will call `sys.inspect` on any objects that are passed.  There is special handling for Error objects.

    var logging = require('logg');
    
    var logger = logging.getLogger('my.class');
    logger.setLogLevel(logging.Level.WARN);
    logger.info('This will not show up');
    logger.warn('But warnings will', new Error('aargg')); 

Loggers are arranged in a hierarchy based on their names, separated by dots.  Log reporting levels are inherited based on the hierarchy, INFO being the default level.  For example, the following will silence everything but errors within the `subproject` namespace:

    var a = logging.getLogger('project.subproject.foo');
    var b = logging.getLogger('project.subproject.bar');
    var c = logging.getLogger('project.subproject.baz');
    var d = logging.getLogger('project.subproject.bam');
    
    logging.getLogger('project.subproject').setLogLevel(logging.Level.SEVERE);

Every logger can have watchers associated with it, which will get called with a log record.  Usually you'd just want to attach to root logger.

    logging.registerWatcher(function(logRecord) {
      // Don't use sync API in real life...
      fs.writeFileSync('logs.log', JSON.stringify(logRecord) + '\n');
    });

A default watcher is automatically registered which outputs to the console.
